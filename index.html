<H2>Introduction</H2>
</CENTER>

The MPTP $100 Challenges are sets of classical first-order reasoning
problems, expressed in the <A HREF="http://www.tptp.org">TPTP language</A>,
to be proved by fully automated reasoning systems, within specified 
reasonable resource constraints.
The challenge problems are based on the Mizar Mathematical Library.
Details of the challenge problems, and the system execution environment,
are described below.
<P>
The goal of the MPTP challenges is to boost the development of Automated 
Theorem Proving (ATP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods and tools for 
reasoning in large theories that involve large numbers of consistently used 
concepts. 
Such tools are increasingly needed for proof assistance over large formal 
mathematical knowledge bases, and also more generally for reasoning over 
any sufficiently semantically specified "real-world" knowledge bases.
<P>
The winners of the MPTP challenges will be announced at 
<A HREF="http://www-cade.kohlhase.net/meetings/cade21">CADE-21</A>, 
and will each receive $100 in real US dollars ... who says there's no 
money in ATP!

<H2>The Mizar Mathematical Library</H2>
</CENTER>

<A HREF="http://mizar.org/">Mizar</A> is a formal language derived from the 
mathematical vernacular.
It is characterized by the intuitive Jaskowski-style of natural deduction.
It is also a proof checker for this language, and a long-term project focused 
on formalization of mathematics. 
There are two important features that distinguish Mizar from other proof 
assistants: 
<UL>
<LI> It is essentially a first-order system (based on set theory). 
<LI> It focuses on the development of the large Mizar Mathematical Library 
     (MML), which (as of July 2006) contains 942 formal articles (with 42694 
     theorems, and 7957 definitions) from various fields of mathematics.
</UL>

Each article in the MML typically contains several theorems, along with 
some set-theoretical definitions of various mathematical notions.
The theorems are proved by natural deduction, from axioms (including
definitions) of set theory, and using previously proved theorems as lemmas.
The dependencies between theorems, in the sense of using previously proved 
theorems as lemmas the proofs of subsequent theorems, form a directed acyclic 
graph (DAG).
The leaves of the DAG are the axioms of set theory (including definitions), 
and the internal and root nodes are Mizar theorems.
Edges run from the axioms and lemmas used in each proof, to the the proved 
theorem.
The DAG has a cannonical topological sorting (i.e. a DAG-compatible linear 
order) called <EM>the MML order</EM>. 
This linear order is given mainly by the chronological order of article 
submissions to the MML.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://wiki.mizar.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Mizar/MpTP">MPTP</A> 
project makes Mizar theorems available as first order ATP problems, by 
translating the axioms, lemmas, and conjecture to plain first order logic 
using relativization of types and de-anonymization of abstract terms.
Additionally, necessary background information that is known to the
Mizar checker, e.g., about the type hierarchies used, is included as axioms.
The resultant ATP problems are exported in the
<A HREF="http://www.tptp.org/TPTP/SyntaxBNF.html">TPTP language</A>.

<H2>The Challenges</H2>
</CENTER>

A sub-DAG of the Mizar theorem graph, as shown in the heading above, has 
been selected as the basis for the challenge (click on the image for a
larger version).
The root of this DAG is the general topological 
<A HREF="http://lipa.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~urban/xmlmml/html_abstr.930/yellow19.html#E37">
theorem</A> relating compactness in terms of open covers and in terms of nets 
(generalization of sequences). 
It says that every net on a compact topological space has a cluster point. 
A converse implication holds too, i.e., compact spaces are exactly those with 
every net having cluster points. 
This 
<A HREF="http://lipa.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~urban/xmlmml/html.930/yellow19.html#T35">
equivalence</A> is the topological generalization of the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theorem_of_Bolzano-Weierstrass">
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem</A>. 
Only one implication was chosen for the MPTP challenge, in order to make the 
size of the DAG reasonable.
The DAG forms a <EM>bush</EM> of theorems, in which each branch from an
leaf to the root forms a <EM>chain</EM> of theorems that Mizar uses as 
lemmas in proofs of subsequent theorems in the chain.
For the MPTP challenge, each internal and root node of the DAG is used to 
form two ATP problems, as described below.
You can view the Mizar presentation of 
<A HREF="http://lipa.ms.mff.cuni.cz/~urban/xmlmml/html_abstr.930/00mptp_chall_topdown.html">
just the MPTP challenge problems</A>,
in topdown (reverse MML) order</A>, with access to the Mizar justifications.
<P>
The challenge is divided into two divisions: the 
<EM><A HREF="BushyGIF.html">bushy</A> division</EM>, and the
<EM><A HREF="ChainyGIF.html">chainy</A> division</EM>.
<UL>
<LI> In the bushy division, each internal and root node of the DAG is converted 
     to a FOF problem, using the MPTP translation.
     The conjecture of the problem is the theorem of the node, and the axioms of 
     the problem are the parent leaves of the node, augmented by the necessary 
     background.
     Thus the problems in this division require each theorem to be proved from
     the relevant preexisting MML theorems, emulating a smart user who knows 
     what ingredients should be involved in the proof, and who is using an ATP 
     system to find the formal proof.
<P>
<LI> In the chainy division, each bushy problem is augmented by lemmas (and 
     associated symbol definitions) formed from all the DAG nodes that precede 
     the conjecture in the MML order.
     Such lemmas were, roughly speaking, available at the time of proving the 
     theorem in Mizar.
     Some of the lemmas (those that are in the <EM>chain</EM>s of ancestors of 
     the conjecture) are likely to be useful for finding a proof, while the 
     others (those that are not ancestors of the conjecture) are unlikely to 
     be useful.
     Thus the problems in the chainy division require the theorem to be proved 
     "from the whole available MML", emulating a lazy user who does not want to 
     do any work, and wants to have good tools for automated reasoning over a 
     large knowledge base. 
     A smart (possibly heuristical) selection of relevant parts of MML is 
     therefore likely to be needed for this division. 
     Re-using knowledge gained from solving previous chainy problems should be 
     therefore useful (note that the symbols in all problems are used 
     consistently in both divisions, i.e., they always have the same semantics).
     Using complementary AI techniques like machine learning from solved 
     problems is encouraged. 
     See below for the flexible scheduling arrangements useful for this.

<A HREF="MPTPChallenge.tgz">
<STRONG>Here are the challenge problems in TPTP format</STRONG></A>
(this distribution includes some bugfixes, and supercedes the original.)
</CENTER>
<P>
Systems are entered into the challenge by submitting the source code, with
installation instructions, to the organizers by the 
<A HREF="../CASC/21/Schedule.html">CASC system installation deadline</A> 
(just to make Geoff's life easier :-).
Systems may be pretuned for the challenge, but not to the extent of recording 
specific information about individual problems.
Systems may retune themselves in any way during execution, including recording 
specific information about encountered problems.
The source code will be publically available from this WWW site, 
providing a research resource and public scrutiny to discourage any cheating.
<P>
Execution of a system in each division is governed by an overall CPU time 
limit of 300s times the number of problems.
Systems may accept, as a command line parameter, the name of a file that 
lists the names of all the problem files (one problem file name per line), 
and then schedule the use of the overall time limit internally.
Alternatively, the organizers can run the system independently on each
problem with a 300s limit - the same command line is used for all problems 
(in this mode, if a problem is solved in less than 300s the remaining time 
is forfeit, i.e., it's smarter to use the overall limit mode).
<P>
The winner of each division is the system that solves the most problems.
In the event of a tie, the system with the lowest average CPU time used over 
the problems solved is the winner.
<P>
The MPTP challenge is organized by
<A HREF="http://kti.mff.cuni.cz/~urban/">Josef Urban</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.cs.miami.edu/~geoff/">Geoff Sutcliffe</A>.
Questions should be emailed to the organizers after you've checked the
<A HREF="http://wiki.mizar.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Mizar/MpTPChallengeFAQ?unlock=on">FAQ</A> for the answer.
